I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [DSP Lab](http://dsp.ee.cuhk.edu.hk) in the Department of Electronic Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk) (CUHK), under the supervision of [Prof. Wing-Kin Ma](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~wkma/). Prior to this, I obtained my B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/) (NWPU) in 2021 and 2024, respectively.
