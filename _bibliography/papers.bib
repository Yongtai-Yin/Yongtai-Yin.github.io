  abstract = {Efficient communication in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems relies on accurate channel estimation to optimize signal transmission efficiency, reliability, and minimize interference and power consumption. However, the presence of non-uniform array gain-phase perturbations among antenna elements poses practical challenges, degrading the precision of estimation. In response, this paper introduces a parameterized joint angle and delay estimation (JADE) method tailored for multipath channel estimation in fully uncalibrated arrays within massive MIMO systems. Our innovative spatial and frequency-based co-smoothing method is proposed to construct a rank-recovered data covariance matrix, enhancing the system's ability to distinguish coherent multipath signals. The JADE method employs a one-dimensional angular spectrum and delay spectrum search under the principle of rank reduction, providing a closed-form solution for array gain-phase perturbation estimates. The deterministic Cram{\'e}r-Rao lower bound for the proposed model is derived. Numerical simulations affirm the method's superior performance. In conclusion, our approach addresses the demand for precise channel estimation in low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios, particularly benefiting Internet of Things (IoT) applications.},

  abstract = {A novel direction of arrival (DOA) estimation method based on smoothed sparse reconstruction with timemodulated linear arrays (TMLA) is proposed in this paper. With the analysis of the noise variation after time modulation, a closed-form expression for the noise covariance under the optimized unidirectional phase center motion time sequence scheme is derived. Then a reweighted continuous function is designed for the smooth approximation to {$l$}0-norm based on the orthogonality between the signal subspace and the noise subspace. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with conventional DOA estimation method with time-modulated arrays, the proposed method possesses higher estimation accuracy and lower computational complexity, especially for the scenario with small snapshot and low signal-to-noise ratio.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the auxiliary vehicle positioning system and localization method for intelligent transportation systems, as a supplement to the Global Navigation Satellite System which is prone to large positioning deviations and even failures in occluded scenes such as urban canyons and tunnels. The time modulated antenna arrays are first introduced into the positioning system, avoiding mutual coupling between antennas and greatly reducing the hardware cost of the vehicle terminal. The auxiliary positioning framework for the smart vehicle is advocated in conjunction with existing radio frequency signals. To take full advantage of the multiple auxiliary sources around the road net, Doppler shifts embedded into the received signals are unearthed, and a smoothed block sparse reconstruction is developed for directly locating the vehicle, providing significant enhancements of degrees of freedom and the localization accuracy. Additionally, the proposed direct localization method is robust to multichannel gain and phase mismatch in practice, and the array perturbations can be estimated and compensated without any calibration source. Extensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed system and method achieves superior localization accuracy (approximately 0.22 m error at SNR of 10 dB), outperforming its state-of-the-art counterparts.},

  abstract = {A novel direction of arrival (DOA) estimation method of noncircular signals based on biquaternion with timemodulated antenna arrays is proposed in this paper. Time-modulated antenna arrays (TMAA) is introduced into the DOA estimation of noncircular signals for the first time, which makes the receiver only need a single RF processing channel, which effectively saves hardware resources. The noncircular features of the signal are fully exploited for virtual array expansion with the biquaternion framework. Aiming at the problem of nonuniform noise in the array output after time modulation, the nonuniform noise correction is realized by using the theoretical analysis of the time sequence scheme. The simulation illustrates that the proposed method has superior performance than conventional DOA estimation method with TMAA, in terms of resolution and numbers of localizable sources.},
